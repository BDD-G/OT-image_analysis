installed packages
- go to requirements.txt path
- Usage: pip install -r requirements.txt

use detect_label_single.py
(Complicated. Need to confirm the file path)

- Usage: python detect_label_single.py --weights "weights(.pt file)-path" --source "image-path"

- If the path is fixed, you can set the default weight file path on line 212 of the "detect_label_single.py"

or

use  in other python file
    source = 'image-path'
    weights-path = "weights(.pt file)-path"
    detect-file-path = 'detect_label_single.py-path'
    # no need to add this if weight has been changed in the detect file (line 212)

    arguments = ["--source", source ,"--weights", weights-path]
    
    detect_process = subprocess.run(["python", detect-file-path] + arguments, capture_output=True, text=True)
    # get the bounding box location
    output = completed_process.stdout

use detection_functions.py (tips amount, liquid level, colour) 
    import detection_functions as DF

    # get informations of tips and liquids
    tips, liquids = DF.detect(output)
    # get liquid threshold
    threshold = DF.save_threshold(tips,liquids)
    # match boxes
    DF.match_boxes(tips,liquids,threshold)
    # detect colour 
    - add more colour (line 128, use hue to adjust colour)
    DF.colour(liquids,source)
